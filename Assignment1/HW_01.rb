# 1. Read an Interview with the Creator of Ruby

# 3. In this file under "Student Solution," print the welcome text of your Secret 
#    Number Game
#
#	(i.e.) "Welcome to the Secret Number Game!"
#
# 4. Above your welcome message, write a comment to other coders introducing yourself.
#	 .
#
#
# 5. Create two new variables, one for your last name, one for your first name
#    and enter your first and last name as strings.
#
#    first_name = ""
#    last_name = ""
#
# 6. Print to the screen that your game was created by you by concating the
